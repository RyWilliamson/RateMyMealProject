Stir in the ground hazelnuts and leave the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. Beat the egg yolks and sugar together with an electric hand-whisk for at least 5 minutes until pale and creamy, then stir into the chocolate mixture until thoroughly combined. Wash and dry the beaters well. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form � they are ready when you can turn the bowl upside down without the eggs sliding out. Do not over whisk. Working quickly, stir the hazelnut liqueur, amaretto or orange juice, into the chocolate mixture to soften. Add a couple of tablespoonfuls of the whisked egg whites and stir until thoroughly combined, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in the centre of the oven for 35�40 minutes or until the cake is well risen and firm. Remove the cake from the oven and leave it to cool in the tin for 30 minutes. Undo the springclip and invert the cake on to a serving plate, then peel off the lining paper and leave it to cool completely. When the cake is cold, spread it with the chocolate and hazelnut spread and sprinkle with the hazelnuts that you set aside � these can be whole or chopped, whatever you prefer."
